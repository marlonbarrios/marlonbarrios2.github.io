# Marlon Barrios Solano
## Portfolio
I am a software engineer, creative technologist, researcher and educator with passion for complexity, networked systems, arts, social innovation and community development. I have an interdisciplinary background: digital technology, arts and cognitive science. For more than 20 years, as a dancer, digital artist and educator, I have always been interested in building systems with rules and software, making, creating community platforms and establishing collaborations. I have always been driven by curiosity and my capacity to see the whole and its parts. I have learned to move fast and efficiently from large scale problems, such as networks to the specificities of software implementation. I have lots of collaborative experience envisioning, engineering, coordinating and passion for deploying cutting edge international projects intersecting software, culture and people. I am fascinated by the potential of the blockchain for financial inclusion and innovation. I am a graduate of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program (December 2021) and a Kernel Fellow Block5 2022.
