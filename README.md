## Portfolio
I have been fascinated by complex and networked systems, the web and online-community development. For more than 20 years, as a dancer, digital artist and educator, I have always been interested in building systems with rules and software, creating community platforms and establishing collaborations. I have always been driven by curiosity and my capacity to see the whole and its parts. I have learned to move fast and efficiently from large scale problems, such as networks to the specificities of software implementation. I have lots of collaborative experience envisioning, engineering, coordinating and passion for deploying cutting edge international projects intersecting software, culture and people. I am fascinated by the potential of the blockchain for financial inclusion and innovation. I am a graduate of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program (December 2021) and a Kernel Fellow Block5 2022. I love creative coding and I teach vipassana meditation and yoga.

### REACT Music Player
![Alt text](musicplayer.png "a title")

I developed this React.js web app for the group to share music adding YouTube muic video and music from SounCloud. The video are added to a list fetching the thunbnail, name and artist data. The user may play them loading the songs in the player and also may create a queue. The personal queue us handled in the browser and the main list and data is managed by Apollo/GraphQR in Hasura/Heroku. You may add some tracks and share the noise!

CryptoMondrian is a desktop App that displays the top 10 cryptocurrencies names and prices in dollars using a CSS grid system inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian. The name and the price are placed in descendent order from the largest to the smaller blocks. The data is fetched using the CoinGecko API. User can click button and refresh data or wait until the data is refreshes every 60 seconds.
